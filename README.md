# Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview

This data visualization project aims to provide valuable insights to management by analyzing various aspects of the company's data. It involves creating visualizations that allow for a better understanding of the data and support decision-making processes. The project consists of five main tasks, each focusing on a different aspect of the data.

## Task 1: Shipping Costs Analysis

Worksheet: Q1

Objective: Management wants to analyze shipping costs across different product categories and subcategories for each ship mode. This task involves creating a table with product categories and subcategories and displaying shipping costs based on the ship mode. The shipping costs are color-coded by product subcategory.

Additional: On a new worksheet titled Q1b, a circle views chart is created to identify any outliers in the data.

## Task 2: Average Sales and Average Discount Analysis

Worksheet: Q2

Objective: This task focuses on calculating and visualizing the average sales and average discount across product categories and subcategories. A bar chart is used to represent the average sales, with color-coding based on average discount. Labels are added to the bar chart to represent average sales for each subcategory.

Additional: A new worksheet titled Q2b explores an alternative visualization to display the same data, aiming to determine if one visualization is preferred over the other.

## Task 3: Top 10 Customers by Profit

Worksheet: Q3

Objective: Historically, the company has provided discounts to its top 10 customers in terms of profit. Packed bubbles are used to find and display these top 10 customers. Cust id is represented by color, and a filter is added to display the top 10 customers based on the sum of profit. The customer ID and sum of profit are displayed within the bubbles.

## Task 4: Product Base Margin Proportion

Worksheet: Q4

Objective: Management wants to understand the proportion of the product base margin across the three product categories. A pie chart is used to display the split of the sum of product base margin across the categories. The angle of the pie chart is dependent on the sum of product base margin, and sections of the pie chart are labeled with the product category and sum of product base margin.

## Task 5: Product Profit and Sales Comparison by Quarter

Objective: Management wants to compare product profit and sales by quarter, focusing on each product subcategory. This task allows flexibility in choosing the most suitable data visualization for the comparison. Labels for profit, sales, and product subcategories are added, along with appropriate colors to enhance visualization.

Hint: There are multiple visualization options available for this task, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your preference.

By completing these tasks, you will provide management with a comprehensive view of various aspects of the company's data, facilitating data-driven decision-making processes.
